## Contribution Guidelines
Please adhere to the following basic rules for contributing to one of the repositories:

### Starting Work on a New Feature
1. **Create a New Branch**: Whenever you start working on a new feature, first create a new branch from the main branch. Name the branch in a way that reflects the feature you're working on. e.g. `add-billing-module`. When your branch is related to an issue, prepend its name with the issue number. e.g. `722-add-billing-module`. 

2. **Develop the Feature**: Implement your feature in the newly created branch. Keep your code clean and well-documented.

3. **Testing**: Thoroughly test your feature to ensure it works as intended and does not introduce new bugs.

### Creating a Pull Request
1. **Pull Request**: Once your feature is ready and tested, create a pull request against the main branch. Provide a clear and detailed description of what your feature does and any other relevant information.

2. **Request Reviews**: Request reviews from others by clicking on their names in the pull request interface in the top right of the PR screen.

3. **Incorporate Feedback**: Address any feedback or suggestions from your reviewers.

### Merging the Feature
1. **Approval**: Wait for approval.

2. **Merge**: After receiving approval and resolving any conflicts, merge your branch into the main branch. Delete the feature branch if it's no longer needed.

### General Rules
- **Code Review**: Participate in code reviews for others to ensure that the project maintains high-quality standards.
- **Be moderately silly**: ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° )
